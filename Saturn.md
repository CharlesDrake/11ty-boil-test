# Why have we not visited **Saturn!?**

Space travel is a big concept in today's current society. As humans, we have 
managed to fly and even step foot on the moon. However, we want to go even 
further than that. Not being able to reach many planets fast enough, due to how
far away they are, we have to resort to sending drones and rovers to due the
exploration for us. One example is the Curiosity rover that is currently on Mars.
But, this begs the question as to what other reasons are there that are stopping
us from visiting other planets? In this blog I want to explore the reasons that
Saturn is currently out of our reach.  

Saturn is the sixth planet in our solar system which is the most obvious reason
we can not reach it. It is also, the second largest planet behind Jupiter. Apart
from Saturn being about 980 miles away from Earth, Saturn is also mainly just a 
gaint planet made of gas and liquid. Since this is the case, there is no where 
for any spaceship or even a rover to land on the planet surface. Furthermore, many
would think that since Saturn is a gas and liquid planet you can just fly through
and around it. However, Saturn has really extreme temperatures and pressure that 
would cause most ships and rovers to be crush and destroyed. 

Knowing these different aspects of Saturn, exploring it with the current technology
that we have would be almost impossible. We would need to find a way to land on gas
and liquid on the planet and find ways to not only reinforce our ships but also 
ourselves so we do not get crushed by the pressure that comes from the planet.
