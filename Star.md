Apart from space travel that is more targeted to that of finding not just planets
but, habitable planets as well, is the massive amount of stars that are found 
in the universe. The most important star that we know of is our Sun which helps
to maintain life on our planet. The Sun being the center of our solar system and
the largest thing in our solar system. Even though the Sun is the largest in our
solar system, it is not the largest known star. That achievement would go to the
star, UY Scuti.

The UY Scuti was originally discovered by German astronomers back in 1860. 
However, it was not until 2012 that it was able to be documented better due to 
better technology. With this technology, they were able to document that the UY
Scuti as a red supergiant and is about 7 to 10 times larger than our Sun. This 
star is located in the Milky Way galaxy and is about 5 light years away from Earth.
One interesting thing about the UY Scuti is that it is constantly changing 
brightness due to it pulsating.

Knowing there are stars that are out there that are bigger than our own is very 
fascinating. It makes you think how small you are compared to everything in our 
universe. This probably not even the largest star out there, it is just the 
largest the we can see and have documented.
